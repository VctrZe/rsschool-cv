## **About Me**

I am a Frontend Engineer Apprentice at RS School with a passion for using technology to solve real-world tech problems, even though I come from a non-traditional background.

My interest in technology started when I worked as manager at small web-studio. I often thought of how technology could relieve our difficulties. Once, I had a conversation with a profound software engineer that made me realize the potential of technology, and ever since then, I have been devoted to this field.

As I decided to transition into web developing, I made a commitment to continuous learning and self-discovery. I have a passion for problem solving, collaborating with people to come up with great ideas, and an eagerness to explore new technologies. Struggling with imposter syndrome, I gained confidence as I completed projects and mastered by experienced engineers at RS School.
